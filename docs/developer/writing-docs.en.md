# Writing Developer Documentation

**[English](writing-docs.en.md)** | [中文](writing-docs.zh.md)

Guide for creating and maintaining docs in this directory.

## Purpose

These docs are primarily for AI coding agents, secondarily for humans. They should:

- Explain patterns that aren't obvious from reading the code
- Guide AI agents away from common mistakes (old patterns, anti-patterns)
- Be "evergreen" - updated as the app evolves

They should **not** teach libraries (AI knows Zustand, React Query, etc.) or duplicate code.

## When to Write a New Doc

| Situation                           | Action                            |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| New architectural pattern or system | Create new doc                    |
| Enhancement to existing system      | Update existing doc               |
| One-off implementation detail       | Don't document - it's in the code |

New docs should be added to `README.md` in this directory.

## Content Guidelines

### Include

- The "why" behind non-obvious decisions
- "How to add X" sections for patterns not obvious from code
- Common mistakes (especially from outdated AI training data)
- Cross-links to related docs: `See [state-management.en.md](./state-management.en.md)`

### Exclude

- Implementation details that don't affect usage
- Library tutorials
- Checklists (AI generates these compulsively - resist)
- "Future Enhancements" or speculative sections
- Large code blocks duplicating the codebase

## Code Examples

Keep examples minimal. Use ✅/❌ format:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Subscribes to entire store
const { visible } = useUIStore()

// ✅ GOOD: Selector for specific value
const visible = useUIStore(state => state.visible)
```

Reference actual files when helpful: "See `src/lib/menu.ts` for the full implementation."

## Formatting

| Element        | Use For                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tables         | Comparing options, quick reference   |
| ✅/❌ examples | Correct vs incorrect patterns        |
| `inline code`  | File paths, commands, function names |
| Headings       | Scannable structure                  |

Keep prose brief. Get to the point.

## Token Efficiency

Not the primary goal, but good practice:

- Tables over prose for comparisons
- Don't explain what AI already knows
- Link to other docs instead of repeating content
- Never sacrifice clarity for brevity

## Maintaining Docs

Update docs when you change the pattern they describe. If you're unsure whether a doc needs updating after code changes, read it - you'll know.
